# MC-Finder
Windows batch file to display hostname and McAfee ePO processes and drivers.

Function: Windows batch file to display hostname and McAfee ePO processes and drivers. Creates an MC_out.txt file in executed directory.

IMPORTANT: Requires WRITE permission within the folder from which batch file is executed. Drivers section is a hack; results may not be accurate.

Works for Standard users and Administrators. Code is NOT tested on McAfee ePO; should work on McAfee VirusScan Enterprise (VSE) 8.8.x & McAfee Agent (MA) 5.x (process list update: 16th April 2020).

P.S. I'm not a 'Pro' in batch scripting. Created as a quick, lazy work - DO NOT expect Updates, Fixes, etc.

Feel free to modify this code and use it in your work/project.
